1. TASK
In the Index.php file there are four classes that determine Human.
* Class Human
    - Basic class Human has function getManProfile which returns array of human`s attributes.
    - That attributes can be saved using function saveManProfile.
    - Function getBloodSteamData (simulates human`s blood steam) calls function getBloodCount which gets data response
      from the API and creates blood count report for the certain person. Each person is uniquely determined with pin.
    - There are also functions getInfo and setInfo that are used to get and save data from db. In the our case this is
      a simulation of brain process of recollection and memories.
* Class Temperament
    This Class inherits Class Human.
    We can use function getManBehavior of this Class to get certain human`s behavior based on temperament characteristics.
* Class Gender
    This Class inherits Class Human.
    Function saveAdditionalData is used to save additional data related to human's gender.
* Class Race
    This Class inherits Class Human.
    Class has a function getCulturalLabelsDeterminedByRace that we use to get cultural labels determined by race
    category.

In order to present mentioned classes we provide en example (Object human is created with certain data).
